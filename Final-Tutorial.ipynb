    "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Pokemon is a very popular game that has been around since 1996. It is created by GameFreak and is exclusive to Nintendo consoles. It has evolved greatly over the years and has also increased in popularity due to the release of the mobile game Pokemon Go. The latest main series pokemon games, \"Pokemon Ultra Sun\" and \"Pokemon Ultra Moon,\" sold over 1 million copies in just the first 3 days after its release. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The main goal of the pokemon games is to construct a team of 6 pokemon with which you would fight other opponents' teams with. A pokemon is a creature that has many attributes and skills that makes it useful for fighting other pokemon. Some of the more defining characteristics of a Pokemon are its' <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Statistic\">stats</a>, <a href=\"http://pokemon.wikia.com/wiki/Types\">type</a>, height, weight, <a href=\"https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Catch_rate\">catch rate</a>, and gender ratios. A pokemons stats determine how strong it will be in a battle. The higher the stat in an area, the stronger the pokemon is in that area. A pokemon's type referes to the elemental property it is associated with. A pokemon's catch rate determines how hard the pokemon will be to catch in the wild. The lower the value, the harder it is to catch. Although a Pokemon may have many more characteristics, these are the ones that we will be focusing on. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "Our goal is to see if there is a way to determine what a Pokemon's type is given its other characteristics. Our Null Hypothesis is that there is no correlation between a Pokemon and its' attributes. This guide will be a step by step tutorial walking you through the data pipeline. We will be scraping data, tidying it, analyzing it, and training a machine learning algorithm. We hope that people can use this tutorial as a basis to do even further and more complex analysis on the pokemon data.\n",

A <a href=\"http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss.html\">Zero-One Loss function</a> will essentially tell us how successful the algorithm was in determining a Pokemon's type. A value close to 1 would mean that it was not very successful while a value close to 0 would mean that it was successful. We want to see what amount of neighbors gives us the lowest Zero-One loss value. Below is our code to do this with comments explaining what each line is doing."
